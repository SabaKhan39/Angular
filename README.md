# Welcome to MyAngularApp

This project is generated using Angular CLI version 17.3.6.

## Development Server

To start the development server, run `ng serve` in your terminal. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your web browser. The application will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI provides code scaffolding to quickly generate components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules. You can use the following command:

```
ng generate component component-name
```

Replace `component-name` with the name of the component you want to generate.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This command is useful when you're ready to deploy your application to a server.

## Running Unit Tests

Angular CLI allows you to execute unit tests via Karma. Run the following command to run unit tests:

```
ng test
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

You can also execute end-to-end tests using Angular CLI. However, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities. Once added, run the following command:

```
ng e2e
```

## Need Further Help?
